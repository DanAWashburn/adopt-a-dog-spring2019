The adopt-a-dog website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its developers scoff at those who would rely on Bootstrap. Scoff I say!

It runs on all major browsers and is compatible with a variety of screen sizes, though it excels most on larger formats.

The site offers users a quick and easy to browse a selection of dogs. It also enables them to select dogs for more information. Users can read about key dimensions of dog ownership and check out once they have settled on their canine. The siteâ€™s Lorem Ipsum allows users to practice their nonsense Latin.
